# ThreeTacToe
## A TicTacToe game for the Nintendo 3DS (*Almost*).

### This game presents the original game with a little twist: Players only have three seconds to move.

This makes the game more dynamic and fun, having to quickly make a decision in order to win.

The clock is visible in the bottom left of the bottom screen.

### What if you don't move?
The other player will be able to move, even if you didn't place a piece.

### Classic Mode
Classic mode is still playable. That is: Tic-Tac-Toe without time mechanics.

## Online mode?
As of now, it is not available. Hopefully it will in the future.
